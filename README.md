# twtr

`twtr` (pronounced "tweeter") is a drop-in replacement of the original
[`twtxt`](https://github.com/buckket/twtxt) client, with some extensions and
bonus features, so you can make the switch without any compatibility issues.

The client is written in Go, hopefully the compatibility promise will prevent
the types of issues that the original is experiencing due to the Python team
making breaking changes.

To install `twtr`, run:

```shell
go install duriny.envs.sh/twtr@latest
```
