# twtxt

A twtxt client in Go, hopefully the Go compatibility promise will prevent the
issues that original https://github.com/buckket/twtxt is experiencing due to the
Python team making breaking changes.

## `twtr`

The `twtr` client (pronounced tweeter) is a drop-in replacement for the original
`twtxt` command line tool, with some extensions and bonus features, so you can
switch without any compatibility issues.

To install `twtr`, run:

```shell
go install duriny.envs.sh/go/twtxt/twtr@latest
```
